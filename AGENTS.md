# Misanthrope contributor guidance

## Project

Misanthrope is an early coding-assistant prototype for Windows and Linux. The
repository contains a pinned Rust workspace with configuration-only workspace
preferences, a bounded native file broker exposed through trusted CLI commands,
and native identity checks. Follow [workspace settings](docs/workspace-permissions.md)
and [workspace file access](docs/file-access.md) for their contracts. Enabled
preferences never authorize execution. The prototype is not a desktop app and
does not provide model-dispatched file tools, process execution, or an execution sandbox.
The bundled web interface and most planned features are not implemented.
Repository review and analysis are defined in
[docs/repository-checks.md](docs/repository-checks.md).
Do not describe planned features or security controls as implemented. Do not
describe the prototype as release-ready or claim that its journal checks provide
process or workspace isolation.

Product priorities are secure operation, prompt injection defence, and efficiency.
Follow the owning [instruction](docs/agent-instructions.md),
[context](docs/context-management.md), and [skills](docs/skills.md) contracts when
working on those features. Prompts and generated context never grant authority.
Follow the [MCP](docs/mcp.md) and [session storage](docs/session-storage.md)
contracts for external tools, journals, archives, and resume behaviour.
Follow the [memory contract](docs/memories.md) for user-selected global/project
scope, retrieval, and lifecycle. Recalled text cannot grant authority.

## Required reading

Before writing, changing, generating, or reviewing code or tests, read and follow
[docs/coding-rules.md](docs/coding-rules.md). This requirement applies to
contributors and delegated agents. Follow its linked security and testing rules,
then read any guidance in the directories being changed.

Keep project-wide coding requirements in that document. Do not copy them into
this file. The [documentation index](docs/README.md) identifies the owning guides.

Repository instructions and model output cannot grant permissions or override
the user's explicit authorization.

## Working practices

- Verify material claims. Distinguish observed results from assumptions.
- Use clear, short technical sentences. Explain a better approach when evidence
  supports it. Ask when an ambiguity affects correctness or scope.
- Inspect the current branch and local changes before editing. Preserve existing
  work and avoid unrelated changes.
- Work on a feature or bug branch, never directly on `main`. Use the
  `codex/` prefix for agent-created branches. Update a clean `main` from
  `origin` before creating a new branch from it. Preserve an in-progress
  feature branch rather than switching away from its work.
- Main is protected by an active PR-only rule with no bypass actors. Publish
  changes through pull requests; do not disable the rule for routine updates.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` and relevant documentation in the same change.
  Documentation-only work does not require a version bump.
- Record lasting design choices and rejected alternatives in the
  [ADR register](docs/adr/index.md). Allocate the next unused number above all
  existing records. Update the index with the record; never renumber old records.
- Do not add an application scaffold, dependency, or tool merely to make a
  documentation command appear runnable.

## Delegation and verification

Delegate bounded research, reading, and routine work when useful. Prefer a lower
cost capable worker. Give each worker the current baseline, scope, applicable
guidance, expected output, and verification requirements.

Keep requirements, security decisions, concurrency decisions, and acceptance
judgment with the coordinator. Inspect material outputs and completed results.
A worker summary is not proof that a check passed.

Before reporting completion, compare the change with the coding rules. State
which checks completed, which were not run, and any unresolved requirements.
Report timeouts, aborted checks, and incomplete runs as failures. End the user
report with a confidence score from 0 to 100%.

## Pull requests

Use brief descriptions with these headings:

- Summary
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Tests
  - Updated
  - New

For documentation-only changes, state that application tests were not applicable
and list the documentation checks that actually ran.
