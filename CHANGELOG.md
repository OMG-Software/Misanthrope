Changes are recorded here before a release version is assigned.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Reserve terminal journal capacity, recover full legacy active turns with one
  bounded terminal tail, and test write-success/sync-failure handling.
- Preflight encoded request events before starting turns, mark deterministic
  reply-size failures as failed turns, and retain locators on chat errors.
- Return lossless native journal locators and support reopening paths that are
  not Unicode; prevent renaming open Windows journals with delete sharing denied.
- Redact the configured local server token from retained/displayed chat text
  and resumed context, and apply a total deadline to each model request.
- Apply title redaction to direct session creation as well as chat, and verify
  redaction of credentials seeded in historical conversation text.
- Add review regression tests and clarify smoke-check, coverage, and CLI examples.

### Added

- First Rust 0.1.0 CLI prototype, with a pinned toolchain, locked dependencies,
  and native Windows/Linux formatting, lint, and test workflow.
- Compiled base prompt inspection, lower-priority per-request user instructions,
  bounded LM Studio chat, and refusal of all model-requested tools.
- Typed JSONL session creation, request manifests, exclusive writer ownership,
  strict replay validation, archive/restore, and explicit abandoned-turn recovery.
- Native journal-handle checks, prompt/provider/journal/CLI tests, a development
  guide, and an ADR separating this prototype from future controlled execution.
- User-selected project/global memories with review, edit, delete, disable,
  scoped retrieval, provenance, and context/cache invalidation requirements.
- A memory-scope ADR and memory guidance in draft system prompt version 0.1.2.
- A compiled, read-only base prompt contract with separate lower-priority user
  customization and current-task input; draft prompt version 0.1.1.
- MCP client requirements for stdio and Streamable HTTP, scoped server/tool
  permissions, authentication, untrusted context, and supervised execution.
- Session archive/restore and versioned JSONL journals in a UTC date tree, with
  stable filenames, a rebuildable index, crash recovery, and no action replay.
- LM Studio as a separate model connection with explicit endpoint, model,
  authentication, and capability qualification.
- MCP/session acceptance requirements and supporting architecture decisions.
- Product priorities for secure operation, prompt injection defence, and efficiency.
- A visible, versioned SYSTEM prompt draft and scoped custom-instruction design.
- Configurable token-based auto-compaction, safe context budgets, provenance,
  bounded summaries, and recovery requirements.
- Scoped artifact and provider prompt caching, invalidation, clear controls,
  and usage measurements without replaying side effects.
- Skills settings for import, removal, enablement, and disablement, with validated
  packages and the existing controlled execution boundary.
- Acceptance requirements and an ADR for instruction/context trust boundaries.
- Initial project overview, provider plans, and Windows/Linux development roadmap.
- Rust coding rules adapted from Merovingian, with security and testing guidance.
- Required contributor guidance, a documentation index, and platform targets.
- An architecture decision register that records the Rust rule adaptations.
- Required ChatGPT and Claude subscription authentication profiles, with provider
  evidence, explicit billing modes, credential lifecycle, and readiness gates.
- General development-tool access through installed or managed toolchain
  profiles, including scoped runtimes, SDKs, outputs, caches, and subprocesses.
- Authentication and toolchain acceptance requirements and supporting ADRs.
- CodeRabbit automatic reviews using project guidelines, CodeQL language-aware
  analysis, and SonarQube Cloud CI configuration.
- PR-only main protection with no bypass actors and blocks on force-pushes
  and branch deletion.
- Repository-wide CodeRabbit guideline scopes, vendor-aware CodeQL selection,
  and precise analysis coverage and Sonar credential setup guidance.
